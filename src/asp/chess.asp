        <h2>NSX and ASX Settlement CHESS** Service</h2>
		<p>NSX has established a Transfer Service agreement between NSX and ASX 
		CHESS.&nbsp; This agreement recognises the NSX as an Australian Market 
		Operator pursuant to ASX Settlement Operating Rue 4.1A and allows NSX to 
		be a recipient of the Transfer Service provided by ASX.&nbsp; This 
		also means that NSX is a Recognised Market Operator under ASX Settlement 
		Operating Rules and as such complies with the conditions set out in ASX 
		Settlement Rule 4.3.13.</p>
		<h2>Requirement of Listing</h2>
        <p>All companies listed on NSX , unless otherwise approved by the NSX, are required to be registered for CHESS** 
        Settlement.</p>
        <p>The settlement of transactions on the NSX occur using CHESS** in 
		electronic settlement form, or as 
		determined by the NSX, a Standard Paper Transfer form.</p>
        <p>CHESS** stands for Clearing House Electronic Sub-register System and 
		is owned and operated by the Australian Securities Exchange Limited 
		subsidiary ASX Settlement.</p>
        <p>The main objective of CHESS** is to reduce the amount of paperwork 
        and thereby speed up transaction processing, while providing added 
        benefits of reduced risk of incomplete or incorrect settlement and 
        greater ease of trading and holding shares for investors.</p>
        <p>CHESS** reduces the amount of paperwork by providing for electronic 
        settlement of share transactions.</p>
        <h2><font color="#FF9933">Benefits for Investors</font></h2>
        <p>With CHESS**, investors, stockbrokers and listed companies enjoy a 
        number of benefits: </p>

        <p>When shares are held in an uncertificated form, you do not have to 
        worry about the security of share certificates, reconciling holdings or 
        forwarding them to your stockbroker. You can provide access for the 
        transfer of any shares you sell by using your Holder Identification 
        Number (HIN) if you are on CHESS**, or Shareholder Reference Number (SRN) 
        if you are issuer sponsored. Both numbers control access to your 
        holdings and so should not be generally disclosed.</p>
        <h2>CHESS Fees</h2>
        <p>For listed companies CHESS** charge an application fee, an 
        annual fee as well as transaction fees on holding movements.&nbsp; The Application and Annual 
        fees are outlined in <a href="listing_fees.asp">Practice Note #1: Listing Fees</a>.&nbsp;CHESS**  fees 
		are billed direct to the issuer each month in arrears.  NSX charges issuers a fee for NSX's participation in the Transfer Facility.</p>
        <h2>Share Registry</h2>
        <p>To operate in CHESS** an issuer must also appoint a Share Registry 
		service or an NSX approved settlement facility able to complete settlement 
		via the CHESS** service.</p>
		<h2>ASX Settlement CHESS Primary Market Facility (optional)</h2>
        <p>For issuers wishing to raise capital either via placement or initial public offering then they can use the Delivery versus Payment (DvP) services of the Primary Market Facility (PMF).  Using DvP for settlement of placements and IPO book builds can be an efficient way for issuers to have their securities settled
		at the same time that payment is made.  The service utilises the ASX Settlement's batch process and operates in an industry standard way.  Application is made direct to ASX Settlement.&nbsp; Further information 
        is outlined in <a href="rules_practicenotes.asp">Practice Note #17: Primary Market Facility</a>.&nbsp;ASX PMF fees 
		are billed direct to the issuer on application.  NSX does not charge issuers for access to the PMF.</p>
