	<p>NSX does not have a one size fits all approach to the market trading of listed securities.  </p>
<p>NSX offers the conventional listing model that is standard across exchanges, but we know that although this model suits the vast majority of listing companies there are some that want something slightly different.  
NSX has created two other flexible trading options to tailor a more bespoke solution to this group. </p>

</p><p>These three trading models are:</p>
<ol><li><b>Conventional</b> – standard market trading model chosen by 95 percent of companies with no investor or trading time restrictions.  
Any investor can invest in any company at any time during business hours in this type of trading model.  
The vast majority of our listed companies choose this trading model as it represents the standard and best known form of stock trading. 
</li><br><br>

<li><b>Closed market</b> – investors are restricted to a particular group specified by the listed company.  
This model is popular with cooperatives with a restricted membership type ownership base.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Trading Windows</b> – trading occurs only twice a year for six weeks after semi and annual reporting.  
This restriction in trading times has the advantages of focusing liquidity around periods where news occurs and away from quiet periods.  
Trading windows is currently restricted to property-based managed investment schemes.
</li>
</ol>

<p>We are always open to discussing your particular requirements to provide the best possible solution to your needs.</p>
