		<b>File Formats for uploading an announcement</b>
		<p>Currently the NSX accepts announcements in the following formats:</p>
		
		<p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Adobe Acrobat (PDF), (unlocked file)</li>
		  
		  </ul>
		
		</p>
		<p>Other formats can be supported or removed as required. The preferred format is Adobe PDF as this offers the highest level of security, format presentation and cross platform compatibility.</p>
		
    <b>Security aspects</b>
		<p>For security reasons executable programs, scripts or documents without extensions are NOT allowed.</p>
		<b>Speed of Transfer</b>
		<p>Documents can only be transferred as fast as your
      connection allows. Please be patient
      while the transfer proceeds. Generally, internet transfer speeds are
      faster than fax transmissions. If you experience problems with the
      process please <a href="/about/contact_us">Contact Us</a></p>
      
      
		<b>Authorisation</b>
		<p>Only authorised company representatives can submit announcements. The NSX will verify announcements with the submitter as it sees fit before it is released to the market.</p>
		<b>Additional Users</b>
		<p>A
listed company may have multiple users accessing NSX Company Services.&nbsp;
Some users can be given reporting status while others may be restricted from
doing so.</p>
