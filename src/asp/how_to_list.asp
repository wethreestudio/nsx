        <p>The method of how to list is determined by the type of security to be 
        listed. For example, if capital is to be raised or not or if a special 
        trading market is to be created for a class of instruments. The 
        application process is designed to be as simple as possible. </p>
        <p>The NSX listing rules reflect international standards and seek to 
        achieve an appropriate balance between providing issuers with access to 
        the market at the earliest opportunity and providing investors both with 
        certain safeguards and with sufficient and timely information. The 
        purpose of this is to enable investors to make an informed decision as 
        to the value and merits of the securities listed on the NSX. A full set 
        of listing rules is available from the NSX website and should be 
        obtained before making an application to list.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF9933"><b>Compliance Listing</b></font></p>
        <p>Issuers may list securities on the NSX if those securities meet the 
        criteria for listing. This is termed a compliance listing and is the 
        quickest and most cost effect means to obtain a listing. Issuers seeking 
        a compliance listing should not have raised capital at least three (3) 
        months before listing and may not raise capital three (3) months after 
        listing</p>
        <p><font color="#FF9933"><b>Capital Raising Listing</b></font></p>
        <p>Issuers can issue a prospectus and raise capital using that document. 
        The prospectus can state that the securities are to be listed on the 
        NSX. All documentation must be given to the NSX within seven (7) days of 
        lodging the prospectus with ASIC. On successful completion of the 
        prospectus and submission of required documentation, the securities can 
        begin trading on the NSX.</p>
