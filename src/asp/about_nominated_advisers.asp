		help Issuers to list on the NSX</b></font></h2>
        <p>To list on the NSX it is required that a Nominated Adviser is 
        appointed to assist the issuer with the admission procedure and 
        compliance with ongoing obligations under the NSX Rules. This sections 
        explains in detail the role of the advisers and other steps to be taken 
        in order to list securities on the NSX.</p>
        <h2><font color="#FF9933"><b>Eligibility</b></font></h2>
        <p>The appointed adviser can only be a registered NSX adviser. Eligible 
        organisations are stockbrokers, banker, lawyers, accountants or other 
        professionals experienced in corporate finance.</p>
        <h2>Their Role</h2>
        <p>The nominated advisers role is to help the issuer’s board with the 
        application process by ensuring that the directors have been guided and 
        advised on their responsibilities and obligations under the NSX rules.
        </p>
        <p>The nominated adviser also will explain the NSX rules to the board 
        although specialist may be needed to cover areas of the rules that fall 
        outside of the adviser’s range of expertise.</p>
        <p>Because the directors are responsible for compliance with the NSX’s 
        rules, it is essential that they are confident that they understand 
        their responsibilities and have taken the steps required to ensure the 
        information in the application for listing is complete and correct. At 
        the time of admission, the nominated adviser will confirm to the NSX 
        that the issuer has complied with the relevant rules. </p>
        <p>Once the securities are admitted to the market, the nominated adviser 
        needs to be available at all times to guide and advise the issuer and 
        provide further assistance as needed.</p>
        <h2>How to become a nominated Adviser</h2>
        <p>Details of how to apply to become an NSX registered nominated are 
        available from the NSX website. The application fee is $2,500 and the 
        annual fee is $1,000 (excl GST).</p>
        <h2>How long is a nominated adviser required?</h2>
        <p>Issuers are required, under the NSX rules, to retain the services of 
        a nominated adviser at all times. To guard against the possible 
        resignation of an adviser it is recommended that you agree to a notice 
        period at the time of appointment to provide sufficient time to engage 
        another adviser.</p>
