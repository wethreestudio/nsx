        <h2>NSX and CHESS</h2>
		<p>NSX has established a Transfer Service agreement between NSX and ASX 
		CHESS.&nbsp; This agreement recognises the NSX as a Australian Market 
		Licencee pursuant to ASX Settlement Operating Rue 4.1A and allows NSX to 
		be a recipient of the Transfer Service provided by ASX.&nbsp; This 
		also means that NSX is a Recognised Market Operator under ASX Settlement 
		Operating Rules and as such complies with the conditions set out in ASX 
		Settlement Rule 4.3.13.</p>
		<h2>Broker participant requirements</h2>
        <p>It is a requirement that a broker participant settle trades via 
        CHESS.&nbsp; Settlement can be arranged by direct participation in 
        CHESS, or via an approved agent.&nbsp; Please feel free to discuss your 
        options with NSX to ascertain the best solution for your needs.</p>
        <p>NSX allocates a CHESS PID to each broker participant which is unique 
        and is used to settle trades on your behalf.</p>
        <h2>Requirement of Listing for Companies</h2>
        <p>All companies listed on NSX are required to be registered for CHESS 
        Settlement.</p>
        <p>The settlement of transactions on the NSX occur using CHESS.</p>
        <p>CHESS** stands for Clearing House Electronic Sub-register System.</p>
        <p>The main objective of CHESS** is to reduce the amount of paperwork 
        and thereby speed up transaction processing, while providing added 
        benefits of reduced risk of incomplete or incorrect settlement and 
        greater ease of trading and holding shares for investors.</p>
        <p>CHESS** reduces the amount of paperwork by providing for electronic 
        settlement of share transactions.</p>
        <h2>Fees</h2>
        <p>Standard CHESS fees apply.</p>
